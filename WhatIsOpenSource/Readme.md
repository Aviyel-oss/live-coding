# What is Open Source and how to contribute?

You may have come across the term "open source," if you were a developer. You're exactly in the right place if you ever wonder what all of it is and how to contribute. Now, you're probably wondering what open source is if you're a new developer exactly? How can you begin? What should you expect? Well, we shall cover all this and more in this webinar session.

## What is Open Source?

The term "open source" refers to source code that is made available to the public for viewing, use, modification, and distribution under a permissive license. It is often in the best interests of a company or individual to open-source their code, whether they are an individual, a corporation, a small business, a non-profit, or a government agency.

## How to Contribute to Open Source?

Contributing to an open-source project does not require you to contribute to the codebase itself. In many ways, you can contribute to the open-source like:

- You can add a description to the documentation of a project to discuss a particular point.
- You can provide guidance on a particular project
- Examples of how code works can be added.
- You can write project tutorials.
- For a project, you can add a translation
- You can answer questions concerning a project.
- You can correctly fix types and set the work folder of the project
